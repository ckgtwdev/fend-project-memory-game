# Memory/Matching Game Project
A simple relaxing game where your goal is to match 8 pairs of cards as quickly as possible and with as few moves as possible.

## Getting Started

Clone this project, open the `index.html` file with your browser and start playing! Its as simple as that.

### Prerequisites

The project requires a Font Awesome js file (icons) and  Sweet Alert js file (a simple popup).
Pointers to both of these are included in the `index.html` head file.

```<script defer src="js/fontawesome-all.min.js"></script>```

```<script src="https://unpkg.com/sweetalert/dist/sweetalert.min.js"></script>```

I have included a basic Font awesome js file in my project but you can easily change that to the **CDN** provided on their website [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/get-started).
