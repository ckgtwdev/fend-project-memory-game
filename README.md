## Instructions

This game has 8 pairs of matching cards that need to be matched up before the game can be completed.

To get started, click on a card and try to find its matching partner.  Try to be quick! The timer is ticking and will only stop on game completed or if you refresh the game.

If you manage to find all pairs on 16 clicks you will retain your full 3 star status. Otherwise the more clicks you make will cause those stars to start disappearing.   But don't worry you'll always retain one because you're a STAR!
